               <h2>Watch Me Dream</h2>
               <p>
                  The first band that I was ever in was a metalcore band called Watch Me Dream. This band went through many silly names, such as The Fallen, Interpret the Silence, and Shadow of a Crusader (whatever the heck that means), but Watch Me Dream was the final iteration of the band. I was in & out of this band multiple times, and it didn't last long for me as I quickly learned metal was is not the genre for me, but I did get to play with some cool bands over the years like For the Fallen Dreams, The Ghost Inside, Pierce the Veil, and others.

               <h2>Indians & Astronauts</h2>
               <p>
                  First off: let me acknowledge that this band's name would no longer be considered politically correct. You could say this band was doomed from the start, much like our name was. This was an "indie" or alternative rock band, and we recorded a demo EP that never made it to see the light of day. This band only played two shows before our drummer moved to Utah and everything just kind of fizzled out.

               <h2>Fox & The Fish</h2>
               <p>
                  My most recent full-band project, Fox & The Fish came out of my relocation to Kansas City, MO. I moved out here to start a project with a dear friend of mine and a couple of our other pals. Another indie rock/pop band, we played a couple shows (one with local KC rapper Jooby Truth) and released a demo EP a week before the Covid lockdown started, and haven't been able to find our footing since then. Plan was to rename this group to Medicine Lodge, but not much has come of that so far.

               <p>
                  Not so much a band, but rather my solo project that has gone through various name iterations. Haven't done much with this project, but I've uploaded a couple of EPs to Soundcloud. Another alt rock project, I don't put much time into this these days, especially given how chaotic most days are for me nowadays.

                  <h3>TheRealDIY</h3>
                  <p>
                     A "consious" hip hop group out of Northern California, this groups of some close friends from my hometown. I've recorded with these fellas a couple of times, but was never an official piece of this group. This group was born when I introduced a friend from my high school to my sister's current boyfriend at the time. Fun fact: my sister's (now ex) boyfriend is the half brother of The Grouch from the Bay Area rap group Living Legends (sorry for the namedrop).

                  <p>
                     Another hip hop group, this was a "not so consious" rap group. While I was technically a "member" of this group, not much ever came of it. We played a show once and that was about it. My good friend Geronimo still does his thing these days and I'll link one of his tracks below.

                  <p>
                     Let me preface this one by saying this group was a big joke among our friend group. Another "hip hop" group (if you can call it that), this project was born in a garage while drinks were being enjoyed. This was a goofy project that really should have never been born. LOL *yikes*.

                  <p>
                     One time I tried out for my cousin's metal band (that I don't remember the name of), but didn't end up doing anything with them. They offered for me to play with them temporarily, but I didn't really feel that it was what I was looking for.
